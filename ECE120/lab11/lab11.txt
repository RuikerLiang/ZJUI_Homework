2. Incorrect PCoffset for load operation	line 17
3. One extra comma.												line 19
4. Lack of .END sign											line 42
5. Incorrect PCoffset for load operation	line 30
6. Incorrect order of n and z. 						line 32

Question 2: For each label in the code, write down the corresponding memory location. 
OUTERLOOP	x3004
INNERLOOP	x3005
INPUT			x300E
RESULT		x3011
Question 3: Between using labels and explicit memory locations/offsets, which one makes the most sense, and why?
Labels. Because labels can describe what's this line for. It is also easy to use in instruction than the offset calculation.
